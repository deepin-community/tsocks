  * QA upload.
  * Set the maintainer to Debian QA Group
  * Lintian fixes:
    - Add  ${misc:Depends} to binary package dependencies
    - debian/copyright points to versioned GPL license
    - Add an override for non-dev-pkg-with-shlib-symlink lintian warning
      Package is an small library so makes sense to override this warning
    - Add an override for package-name-doesnt-match-sonames
      Package is a library but it is used with LD_PRELOAD
    - Add an override for no-symbols-control-file

    - Spelling and formatting fixes on tsocks.conf(5) manpage (Closes: #495794)
    - Add an override for rc-version-greater-than-expected-version

      previous Debian releases didn't do it either.
